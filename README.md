# RSS3 Data Sublayer v0.2

The RSS3 Data Sublayer (DSL) v0.2 was a version that served the RSS3 Network Testnet between late 2021 and Oct 2022.

The development and operation of this version provided invaluable practical experience that the RSS3 engineers leveraged for enhancing future iterations.

It is no longer being maintained and has been superseded by the subsequent DSL versions.
